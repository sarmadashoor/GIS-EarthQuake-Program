            <DIV align=justify><B>Tectonic Setting</B><BR>It is seen that the 
            Delhi region has a long seismic history being affected by 
            earthquakes of local origin as well as these on Himalayan origin. 
            Based on the tectonic map of the region prepared by Srivastav and 
            Roy, this region is characterized by several dominant features such 
            as the Delhi - Hardwar ridge, the Aravalli - Delhi fold, the Sdohna 
            fault, the Mathura fault and the Moradabad fault. Verma et al and 
            Chouhan et al., who have have studied more than 100 events recorded 
            in the region have shown that the epicentres have a pattern of 
            clustering in two belts, namely Rohtak and Delhi. They also opine 
            that the local activity shows a switching between these two places, 
            with Rohtak being more active than the Delhi area. The distribution 
            of the epicentres appears to have a NE-SW trend correlated with the 
            direction of major tectonic features of the region. According to 
            these authors it is not possible to associate the seismicity of 
            Delhi with any particular tectonic unit. On the other hand, a number 
            of lineaments appear to be active to various degrees. Extract from

            seismic hazard in detail for the Delhi region has nit been carried 
            out so far. Chouhan estimated the focal depth of earthquake around 
            Delhi to be about 8 km. His frequency-magnitude analysis lead to the 
            conclusion that the maximum size of an earthquake that may occur in 
            this region would be 7.6. The work ofd Srivastav and Roy indicates 
            that in a period of 50 years a magnitude 6 earthquakes is almost 
            certain and that there is 80% probability of a 7 magnitude event 
            visiting the region. Khattri has carried out an exercise estimating 
            the seismic hazard for the northern region of the country. According 
            to this study in a fifty year window of 1983 - 2033, the peak ground 
            accelerations around Delhi would be 0.2 g with 10% probability of 
            excedance. Delhi and its environs have not yet experienced this 
            level of ground vibration in the above tiome period. Even if these 
            estimates need further refinement they indicate the nature of events 
            expected for Delhi city. Extract from Seismic status of Delhi mega 
            city, RN Iyengar.<BR><BR><B>Soil considerations</B><BR>Coupled with 
            the settlement pattern, the geological characteristics, such as 
            depth of alluvial soil, play a crucial role in determining the 
            magnitude of risk.<BR><BR>The Narain-Patel Road section and the 
            Yamuna River - bed section, extending till NOIDA and Faridabad, are 
            more vulnerable to damage even by a moderate earthquake because they 
            are on alluvial soil upto 200 m deep. These regions face a very 
            grave problem of soil liquefication during an earthquake. Moreover, 
            earthquakes are amplified by alluvial soils. The Ridge is 
            comparatively safe as it has a rocky 
            base.<BR><BR><B>Concerns</B><BR>Areas subjected to damaging 
            intensities MSK VIII and VII in 3 earthquakes of Richer M-65 are 
            seen to be as follows: 
            <UL>
              <LI>Considering areas affected during past earthquakes of M - 6.5, 
              it can be expected that such an earthquake occurring in Delhi 
              could adversly affect the whole of it with damaging intensities 
              and more than 50% of the Delhi Metropolitan Area - in terms of 
              probable damage scenario, earthquake would be the worst natural 
              disaster for Delhi. &lt;&gt; An issue of concern to development 
              managers and citizens of the city today is that many groups of 
              Indian and American scientists have forecast a major seismic 
              upheaval of a probable magnitude * or 9 on the Richter scale in 
              North India. The forecast is based on a detailed studey of past 
              Indian earthquakes and analysis of plate tectonics of the region. 
              <LI>As such, management measures in earthquake-related disasters 
              mainly cover actions to minimize structural damage, and 
              preparedness for rescue and relief. In India, where 90% of the 
              population lives in buildings built with out proper guidance from 
              qualified engineers and architects, occurrence of an earthquake of 
              even a medium scale spells disaster. 
              <LI>The Latur earthquake of September, 1993, measuring 6.4 on the 
              Richter scale and inflicting 10,000 casualties, took the 
              scientific community by surprise as it occurred in Seismic of all 
              zones in the country, and has thus compelled them to rethink its 
              impact on Architecture and Planning in the country. 
              <LI>Delhi, which is lies in Seismatic Zone IV, is currently 
              experiencing mild seismicity. An earthquake of magnitude 7.0 on 
              the Richter scale, that was once considered hypothetical, is today 
              a very real possibility. Keeping in view the forecast of a major 
              earthquake resistant design consideration, it has become 
              imperative to size up the earthquake scenario of the city and 
              increase awareness of earthquake resistant 
            techniques.</LI></UL><B>Issues</B><BR>The city's settlement pattern 
            has never been viewed in relation to location and geological 
            characteristics.<BR><BR>Pockets with high rise buildings or 
            ill-designed high-risk areas exist without specific consideration of 
            earthquake resistance. Similarly, unplanned settlements with sub 
            standard structures are also prone to heavy damage even in moderate 
            shaking.<BR><BR>The Central Business District namely Connaught 
            Place, numerous District Centres and sprouting high rise group 
            housing schemes are high risk areas due to the vertical as well as 
            plan configurations. The walled city area, the trans-Yamuna area, 
            and scattered pockets of unplanned settlements also figures as high 
            risk zones due to their substandard structures and high 
            densities.<BR><BR>So far as housing is concerned, vulnerability 
            analysis has never been carried out and preliminary estimate of 
            damages is not available for strengthening of structures under 
            normal improvement development schemes.<BR><BR>The most recent 
            Chamoli earthquake (29 March 1999) was felt all over Delhi. There 
            have been reports of cracks in a few tall buildings located on 
            alluvial deposits in the trans-Yamuna area. This event has been 
            recorded by instruments maintained by CBRI. The ground acceleration 
            recorded in Delhi city has been of the order of 10cm/s2 on soft 
            soil. Three stations on soft soil recorded the event. Stations on 
            hard rock did not record the event at the trigger level of 0.001g 
            acceleration. This implies that the base rock level motions have 
            been amplified by deep soil deposits to the order of 10 cm/s2 at 
            surface level. The narrow band Fourier spectrum indicates strong 
            filtering characteristic of the site which responds mostly near its 
            natural frequency of 1-2 Hz. For engineering evaluation of seismic 
            risk to man-made structures, estimation of the hazard in terms of 
            probable ground acceleration due to future events is essential. 
            Since almost all parameters such as return periods, magnitudes, 
            epicentral locations, and site characteristics are uncertain or 
            random variable, seismic hazard estimation by its very nature is 
            probabilistic. Extract from Seismic status of Delhi mega city, RN
